# Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains three projects on Data Analysis. The first project is on a furniture dataset, second is on uber trip dataset and the third is on TCS Live stock dataset.
# Project No. 1-- E-commerce Furniture Dataset 2024
About Dataset:-This dataset comprises 2,000 entries scraped from AliExpress, detailing a variety of
               furniture products. It captures key sales metrics and product details, offering a
               snapshot of consumer purchasing patterns and market trends in the online furniture
               retail space.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of furniture sales to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and market trends. The analysis will inform business decisions to optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.
# Tools and Technologies
1. Python: Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
2. Tableau: Utilize Tableau for interactive and dynamic visualizations.
3. SQL: Leverage SQL for data querying and manipulation.
4. Machine Learning: Employ machine learning algorithms like regression, decision trees, and clustering for predictive modeling.
   
# Project No. 2-- Uber Trip Analysis
About Dataset:-Uber TLC FOIL Response
               This directory contains data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and
               14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015. Trip-level data on 10 other for-hire vehicle (FHV)
               companies, as well as aggregated data for 329 FHV companies, is also included. All the files are as they were
               received on August 3, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, 2015.
 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze Uber trip data to identify patterns and build a
predictive model for trip demand. The analysis will cover various aspects such as popular
pickup times, busiest days, and fare prediction.
# Tools and Technologies
1. Python: Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
2. Tableau: Utilize Tableau for interactive and dynamic visualizations.
3. SQL: Leverage SQL for data querying and manipulation.

# Project No. 3-- TCS Stock Data - Live and Latest
About Dataset:- This project contains three datasets- TCS_stock_info, TCS_stock_history, TCS_stock_action.
                The TCS_stock_info dataset has two columns zip and 40001, the TCS_stock_history dataset contains eight columns Date, Open, High, Low,	Close,	Volume,	Dividends and	Stock Splits
                The TCS_stock_action dataset contains the columns Date,	Dividends,	Stock Splits

 Project Overview
